Project Structure:

    src_code.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the script for training the pneumonia detection model.
    main.py: Streamlit application script for user interaction and prediction.
    model.h5: Pre-trained pneumonia detection model (generated by src_code.ipynb).

Requirements:

    Python 3.x
    Streamlit (pip install streamlit)
    NumPy (pip install numpy)
    Pandas (pip install pandas)
    Keras (pip install tensorflow keras)
    Pillow (pip install Pillow)

Instructions:

    Clone this repository.
    Install the required libraries (pip install -r requirements.txt).

Pre-training the Model:

    Open the src_code.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
    Follow the instructions within the notebook to download the necessary datasets and train the pneumonia detection model.
    The training process will generate the model.h5 file, which will be used by the Streamlit app.

Running the Web App:

    Ensure the model.h5 file is present in the same directory as main.py.
    Run the Streamlit application: streamlit run main.py.
    Access the app in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Usage:

    Upload a chest X-ray image using the file upload widget.
    Click the "Predict" button.
    The model will analyze the image and display the predicted probability of pneumonia.
